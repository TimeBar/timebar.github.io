                <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
                <details>
                    <summary>Is this really free, and why?</summary>
                    <p>I don't subscribe to the whole "pay for someone's book/diet/advice/app and improve your life".
                        <br>The truth is that your Time is in your hands and no amount of paid services will help you with it.<br> Use what you can, the best resources are free!
                    </p>
                </details>


                <details>
                    <summary>Is it safe / private / offline?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. It runs entirely locally on your computer. nobody can access it and never will.</p>
                </details>


                <details>
                    <summary>What's Rainmeter / Why I need  it?</summary>
                    <p>Rainmeter is an open source, lightweight tool primarily used for Customization. This time, we're using it as a framework for productivity! TimeBar at the moment is built around it, as Rainmeter is extremely efficient and well trusted
                        in the community.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How to uninstall it?</summary>
                    <p>Either delete the "TimeBar" folder in Documents\Rainmeter\Skins or uninstall Rainmeter from the Control Panel.</p>
                </details>



                <details>
                    <summary>Why was this made?</summary>
                    <p>For the same kind of reasons Dune 2021 was made:</p>
                    <img src="img/nolanvilleneuve.jpg" />
                    <p>I was struggling to motivate myself for another, bigger project so I made TimeBar to help me plan.
                        <br>It worked great for me and I found it useful for many other things too, hope it's like that for you as well!
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Is it based on any real world science?</summary>
                    <p>Actually yes, by pure coincidence. As I was making this project a friend told me about the Spoon Theory, which seems to align with the "Chunks" philosophy.</p>
                </details>


                <details>
                    <summary>Is there a Web version?</summary>
                    <p>We feel like we don't need "another app/website/door that you have to open". TimeBar is designed to blend in with your Desktop, so we are not considering making it into another App.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Is there a version for iOS / macOS?</summary>
                    <p>We are currently considering its development.</p>
                </details>


                <details>
                    <summary>Is there a 4K / UHD Version?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, download <a href="UHD_Mode_TimeBar.zip">this hack</a> and follow the instructions inside.</p>
                </details>



                <details>
                    <summary>How can I support this Project?</summary>
                    <p>Please donate or reach out to us by email if you have some concrete ideas and are willing to code!
